\subsection{Vectors}
\label{sec:vectors}

We tried a few given vector classes, but we weren't satisfied
with their features. Most of them don't create new objects
on operations like addition, subtraction etc. which we needed because 
changing the objects may result in unwanted situations. % probably use other words here

\noindent So we made a generic interface for vectors of any size and
implemented a 2D vector with following operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Addition
\item Subtraction
\item Norm
\item Cross product
\item Dot product
\item Normalize
\item Multiply by scalar
\item Rotate 
\item Get angle to x axis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linear combination}
\label{sec:linearCombination}

Since we had several occasions where we had to use a
linear combination, we implemented this as static method
on the vector class to provide it globally.
