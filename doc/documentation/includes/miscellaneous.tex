\subsection{Vectors}
\label{sec:vectors}

We tried a few given vector classes, but we weren't satisfied
with their features. Most of them don't create new objects
on operations like addition, subtraction etc. which we needed because 
changing the objects may result in unwanted situations. % probably use other words here

\noindent So we made a generic interface for vectors of any size and
implemented a 2D vector with following operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Addition
\item Subtraction
\item Norm
\item Cross product
\item Dot product
\item Normalize
\item Multiply by scalar
\item Rotate 
\item Get angle to x axis
\end{itemize}

All operations that do not result in a scalar return a new vector object
instead of changing the one that the operation is called on. We are aware
that this is slower in process time than to change the objects, but most
times we needed new vector objects anyway. Additionally it provides more
safety, since it's not possible to accidentally change a vector object
where it should be cloned.

\subsection{Linear combination}
\label{sec:linearCombination}

Since we had several occasions where we had to use a
linear combination, we implemented this as static method
on the vector class to provide it globally. It solves following
equation: \\

$ \lambda = \frac{-(b_x*v_y - b_y * v_x)}{a_x * b_y - a_y * b_x}$\\

$\mu = \frac{a_x * v_y - a_y * v_x}{a_x * b_y - a_y * b_x} $ \\

TODO : probably explain further
