\section{Abstract}

This document describes the work in the module \emph{Projektarbeit 2 (7308)}
at the Berne university of applied science. We chose to continue our simulation
of traffic which we started in the module \emph{Projektarbeit 1}. The goal
was to develop a driver model that allows virtual cars to drive around on their own.
