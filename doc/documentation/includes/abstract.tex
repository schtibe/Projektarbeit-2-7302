This document describes our work in the module \emph{Projektarbeit 2 (7308)}
at the Berne university of applied science. We chose to continue our traffic simulation
 which we started in the module \emph{Projektarbeit 1}. The goal was to develop an event 
driven multiagent simulation which allows virtual cars to drive around independently and 
to react to the traffic situations autonomously. Autonomy and idependence were only 
possible when the vehicles or more precisely the vehicles drivers would perceive the 
environment on their own. We therefore built a world which consists of objects, that 
are easy to perceive and represent different real world aspects: the waypoints. Thus 
the world now consists of the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item Road, a road has one or many lanes in one or two directions
\item Junction, a junction connects roads
\item Vehicle, a vehicle is operated by a driver which has a consciousness, the Animus
\end{itemize}
All of these are represented by waypoints which are processable by the Animus. 
As one of our main goals was to keep everything as generic as possible to open the 
simulation to a broad range of usages we decided to make cuts in the graphical 
representation in favour of the more complex world design.
