\section{Abstract}

This document describes the work in the module \emph{Projektarbeit 2 (7308)}
at the Berne university of applied science. We chose to continue our traffic simulation
 which we started in the module \emph{Projektarbeit 1}. The goal
was to develop an event driven multiagent simulation which allows virtual cars to drive around on their own.
