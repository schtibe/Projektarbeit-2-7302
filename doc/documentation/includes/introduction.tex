\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this project was to develop a driver model
to enable cars to drive around by themselves. We developed
a simulation where we could implement and test this model.
To provide a stable basis for the driver model we also had
to solve problems concerning the road model and the environment
in general. We also wanted some graphical display of the simulation.
We did not focus hard on that though, it should only be 
rudimentary. It was important to us to implement the things
as generically as possible, to have a code base that is open for
even more features than are now possible to implement in the
given time. Some of these problems with the simulation had 
already been solved in the previous project module. \\

Practical applications for such a driver model could be algorithms for 
cars that are able to roam independently or
simulations which may predict traffic jams.
