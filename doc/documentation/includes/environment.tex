\subsection{The road model}
\label{sec:roadModel}

The road model is defined by an XML file. It contains roads and
junctions that connect together. A road also defines its lanes,


\subsubsection{Lanes}
\label{sec:lanes}
% mention that lanes have "positions" from 0 to 1
% they are composed of lane segments

\subsubsection{Junctions}
\label{sec:junctions}

% junctions offer decisions
% put lane into queue -> ref to lane change

\subsubsection{Bezier curves}

\subsection{Collision detection}

We added some collision detection to the simulation. To cars
that are close are checked for collisions periodically.
