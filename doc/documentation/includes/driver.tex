\label{sec:driver}

The part that does all the acting in this world is the drivers. A
driver looks at the world (\ref{sec:sight}), assesses the situation
and reacts accordingly (\ref{sec:animus}), decides about which
way to go (\ref{sec:driverJunctions}) and eventually steers the
vehicle (\ref{sec:driverInfluence}). Drivers have a character
(\ref{sec:character}) and physical conditions (\ref{sec:physics}). They
can even take drugs (\ref{sec:drugs}). \\

\subsection{Animus}
\label{sec:animus}

The Animus is the brain of the driver. Here all way points 
(\ref{sec:wayPointSystem}) are processed and decisions are made. \\

\noindent The Animus only knows the current speed limit on the lane 
(before the driver has seen any speed limit signs this is some global
default value). It then assesses the situation in following order:

\begin{itemize}
\item Look at the world and collect way points
\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The estimation of other vehicle's speed}

To know whether another vehicle is approaching (because it moves 
more slowly)

\subsection{Physics}
\label{sec:physics}

\subsubsection{Drugs}
\label{sec:drugs}

\subsection{Character}
\label{sec:character}

\subsection{Sight}
\label{sec:sight}

At this point of process the driver only sees things ahead of him on the
lane. There are no mirrors, and it is not possible to look behind, hence
he is not able to reverse.\\

\noindent What the driver can see is limited to a field of view formed as a triangle.
We implemented that as the driver view, more on that in chapter 
\ref{sec:driverView}.
